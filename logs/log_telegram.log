2023-09-11 11:12:44,962 - INFO - User bonjour17 (Ali K , 466910209), Message: "In 2015, I left a promising career as a BI developer to see how data *really* drove business decisions. I joined a Chinese-American ecommerce agency serving well known brands from all over the world.

Today I run the tech side of this agency. I primarily manage data integration and analytics projects that serve our clients needs and empower our operations team. This company was a startup when I first joined so it gave me the opportunity to put on many hats:

- Account manager / store manager: led a cross functional team to operate official online flagship stores for brands. Building processes for efficiency, market research for writing effective copy, optimizing search and ads to boost click-through & conversion.
- Marketer: Managed email marketing to engage our B2B audience. Wrote copy and produced educational content. Used the same B2C click-through optimization techniques from ecommerce operations to keep our audience engaged. This led to several successful partnerships and clients.
- Project manager: hired external developers to quickly launch a market research tool powered by web scraping.
- Tech lead: leading a lean tech team capable of developing complex systems that fulfill internal and client needs


Above is "My Story". I'd like to modify this to show how I went from working in data and ecommerce and then became all focused on Web3"

I first stumbled upon crypto in China when trying to circumvent strict restrictions on foreigners for moving money out of the country. 

But Web3 is more than just an interest now. It’s a community of people building a more ethical financial infrastructure for the future and this is where I’d like to leave my mark in history."

The group is so young and so new that I don't want to dive into anything too deep for awhile. We spend a great deal of our time trying to learn routines and structure. Where do the toys get put back, how can we play with them, where do we sit for bathroom routine, practicing getting my three older ones to pull up pants and put on or take off shoes. All of these skill will benifit soooo much come the winter making everyone's life easier. I am a big believer in constantly talking to the children so I will give them little tasks or ask them simple questions training their ears to be alert and responsive. I'm going to focus alot on these skills for the next little bit while dabbling in some colors, numbers and fall theme type creatives."
